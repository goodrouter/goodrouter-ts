# GoodRouter, TypeScript edition
A good router should:

- [x] work in a server or a client (or any other) environment
- [x] be able to contruct routes based on their name
- [x] should have a simple API!
- [x] not do the actual navigation!
- [x] be framework agnostic
- [x] be very minimal and simple!
